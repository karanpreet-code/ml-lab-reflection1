## 🔬 Lab 1: Introduction to Image Processing and Keras
(https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
In this lab, I learned the fundamentals of image processing, including image representation, preprocessing, and basic transformations.  
I also explored the **Keras library** and understood how to build simple neural network models for image-related tasks.  
This lab helped me understand how raw image data is prepared before being fed into a machine learning model.

## 🖼️ Lab 2: Image Classification with Keras and CNNs
(https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
This lab introduced **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification.  
I learned how convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers work together to extract features from images.  
By implementing a CNN using Keras, I gained practical experience in model training, evaluation, and understanding classification performance.

## 🗣️ Lab 3: Building a Language Model with TensorFlow and Python
(https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
In this lab, I explored **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** by building a basic language model using **TensorFlow**.  
I learned how textual data is tokenized and represented numerically, and how models can learn patterns in sequences of words.  
This lab helped me understand the challenges involved in modeling language data compared to image data.

## 🤗 Lab 4: Introduction to Hugging Face, Gradio, and Fine-Tuning a Model
(https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
This lab provided exposure to modern ML tools and workflows.  
I learned how to use the **Hugging Face** library to work with pre-trained models, how to fine-tune them for specific tasks, and how to build interactive ML applications using **Gradio**.  
This lab demonstrated how advanced models can be adapted efficiently without training from scratch.

## 🧩 Lab 5: Understanding CNN Configurations
(https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
In this lab, I studied various **popular CNN configurations** and their architectural differences.  
I learned how depth, filter size, and layer arrangement affect model performance and applicability.  
Implementing these configurations in TensorFlow helped me understand how CNNs are customized for different problem domains.
