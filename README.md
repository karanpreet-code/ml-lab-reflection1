# 🧠 Machine Learning Lab Portfolio

**Name:** Karanpreet Singh  

This repository documents my learning journey through **five Machine Learning laboratory assignments**.  
Each lab focuses on a core area of modern machine learning and helped me develop both **conceptual clarity** and **hands-on implementation skills** using Python and popular ML frameworks such as **TensorFlow, Keras, and Hugging Face**.

These labs represent an important step in my growth as a machine learning learner, moving from theory to practical model development.

## 🔬 Lab 1: Introduction to Image Processing and Keras

This lab introduced the fundamentals of **image processing**, including how images are represented numerically and prepared for machine learning models.  
I learned essential preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and basic transformations.

Additionally, I explored the **Keras library** and built simple neural network models.  
This lab highlighted the importance of data preprocessing and provided a strong foundation for working with image-based datasets.

## 🖼️ Lab 2: Image Classification with Keras and CNNs

In this lab, I worked with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification.  
I learned how convolutional layers extract features, how pooling layers reduce dimensionality, and how fully connected layers perform classification.

By implementing and training a CNN in Keras, I gained hands-on experience with model design, training, and evaluation.  
This lab strengthened my understanding of deep learning architectures and computer vision concepts.

## 🗣️ Lab 3: Building a Language Model with TensorFlow

This lab introduced me to **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
I learned how text data is tokenized, converted into numerical form, and processed by machine learning models.

Building a basic language model using **TensorFlow** helped me understand how models learn patterns in sequences of words and highlighted the challenges of working with language data compared to images.

## 🤗 Lab 4: Hugging Face, Gradio, and Model Fine-Tuning

This lab focused on modern machine learning tools and workflows.  
I learned how to use **Hugging Face** to work with pre-trained models and fine-tune them for specific tasks.

I also built interactive machine learning applications using **Gradio**, which demonstrated how ML models can be deployed and made accessible to users without training from scratch.

## 🧩 Lab 5: Understanding CNN Configurations

In this lab, I explored different **CNN architectures and configurations**.  
I studied how factors such as network depth, filter size, and layer arrangement affect performance.

Implementing these configurations in TensorFlow helped me understand how CNNs are adapted for different datasets and problem domains.
